She's got serious beef with the Holiday Inn in La Verkin. Tam was very cool, hope to cross paths again. Anyway, this was while we were still near Lee's Pass Trailhead. Probably took us two hours to go a mile there were so many views around here."

Absolutely jarring to go from seeing 6 people in 4 days to about 2 billion in a couple hours. Crushed my knees, my IT band will never forgive me."
