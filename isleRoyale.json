So I kind of had to lean over the shoulder of the stranger next to me to see anything. This picture is actually from our bonus day where we canoed around some of the bays on the island. The plane lined up way too perfectly."

We were all a little tired and dazed and then about 5 feet off the trail a 2000 pound unit just rampaged away. Pretty cool. Probably should be a lil more observant."

It was kind of sketchy, there were a few wood-plank paths that I couldn't see super well and almost slipped off a number of times. Then there's like, no trail at the end and you kind of just try to head eastward. Which is tough when there's no sun. Very very worth it though, I was the only one at the point for a while, was joined by 3 or 4 others right at sunrise."
