So I kind of had to lean over the shoulder of the stranger next to me to see anything. This picture is actually from our bonus day where we canoed around some of the bays on the island. The plane lined up way too perfectly."

We were all a little tired and dazed and then about 5 feet off the trail a 2000 pound unit just rampaged away. Pretty cool. Probably should be a lil more observant."
